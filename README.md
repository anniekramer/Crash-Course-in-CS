# Crash Course in CS
Demystify computer science with this fast and furious approach to the fundamentals of web development, data analysis, and more.

## Goals
- **High-level objectives**:
  * Triage and diagnose basic issues in code
  * Debug basic problems in JavaScript and Python
  * Build a simple web app with a Python backend and a JavaScript frontend
  * Perform simple programmatic data analysis using Python

- **Concrete skills for strong foundations in computer science and working on a software team**:
  * Basic program execution and flow: be able to trace a piece of code line by line and say what it does/outputs)
  * Object-oriented programming (OOP): be able to explain methods and inheritance, the purpose of methods
  * Debugging fundamentals: be able to use the developer console to step through and debug simple programs
  * Fluency in parsing and understanding documentation: e.g. be able to use an official Python module by reading the documentation for it

- **Concrete skills for working on a software team**:
  * Code review: why it's important, what it entails, how to respond to feedback
  * Version control and Git fundamentals: be able to work on a feature branch, understand the relationship between the master branch and feature branches
