# Crash Course in CS
Demystify computer science with this fast and furious approach to the fundamentals of web development, data analysis, and more.

**Goals**
- High-level:
  * Triage and diagnose basic issues in code
  * Debug basic problems in JavaScript and Python
  * Build a simple web app with a Python backend and a JavaScript frontend
  * Perform simple programmatic data analysis using Python

- Concrete skills for strong foundations in computer science:
  * Basic program execution and flow: be able to trace a piece of code line by line and say what it does/outputs)
  * Object-oriented programming (OOP): be able to explain methods and inheritance, the purpose of methods
  * Debugging fundamentals: be able to use the developer console to step through and debug simple programs
  * Fluency in parsing and understanding documentation: e.g. be able to use an official Python module by reading the documentation for it
